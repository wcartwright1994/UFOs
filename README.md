# UFOs
Creating a webpage that allows for filtering a table based on user-input.

**Overview of the UFO Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to:
1. Compile data into a JavaScript table
2. Create additional filters to allow users to input specific parameters
3. Dynamically filter the table based on the user-input into the filters, allowing for more in-depth analysis by the users 

**UFO Analysis Results**

The process involved in updating the table values includes:
1. Typing in a single parameter to view the results
2. Tabbing out of the cell or clicking elsewhere on the webpage to change the table
3. Changing the current parameter or updating an additional parameter
4. Tabbing out of the cell or clicking elsewhere on the webpage to change the table
5. Clearing out certain parameters to view a larger subset or the complete table
6. Tabbing out of the cell or clicking elsewhere on the webpage to change the table

**UFO Analysis Summary**

A drawback of the new design is that it only applies filters to a data table and does not provide summary analytics, the option to sort the table, or the option to export the table.

For further development, it is recommended that additional functionality is added to cover the limitations described above, plus:
1. Allow the user to filter for a date range or specific periods during the year
2. Allow verified users the option to submit additional findings, as there does not appear to be any plans to continuosly update the data with new events
